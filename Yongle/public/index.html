					What was it?
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					The Yongle Encyclopedia was a collection of 22,937 chapters combined into 11,095 volumes of writing by thousands of Chinese scholars
					commanded by Zhu Di, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty from 1402-1424. Its immense length gave it the title of the longest encyclopedia
					in the world. Zhu Di is known to have loved reading, so it makes sense that he wanted to compile so much literature together. The encyclopedia
					was completed at the Imperial Academy in Nanjing, where Nanjing University stands today.

					Contents

					<br>
					<br>
					
					Zhu Di aimed for the encyclopedia to contain all of Chinese knowledge, so it featured a variety of subjects included astronomy, history,
					philosophy, art, literature, religion, and many others. The organization of the encyclopedia is also very interesting because, unlike English,
					Chinese languages do not have any alphabetical order, so instead the encyclopedia was ordered using rhyming syllables. With 370 million Chinese
					characters equivalent to nearly 250 million English words, the encyclopedia is even larger than the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

					Significance

					<br>
					<br>
					
					The Yongle Encyclopedia is very valuable as a collection of works from the beginning of Chinese history until the Ming dynasty. Although many
					volumes are missing, we have still been able to analyze thousands of years of literature and study Chinese culture and history through the 
					large collection. Many plays and dramas have even been performed on stage in modern times, and many unseen poems and tales have been published.

					Legacy

					<br>
					<br>
					
					The original copy of the encyclopedia was lost, but the reason for its disppearance is still a mystery. One theory historians have is that
					the encyclopedia was destroyed in the 1449 fire in Nanjing, a disastrous fire that burned down three entire halls and many other parts of
					the palace. Other historians believe that it may have been burned or destroyed during the late Ming dynasty or early Qing dynasty. Some
					even believe that it is actually hidden inside the palace walls of the Qing dynasty. In addition, many colonists including British soldiers
					took sections of the encyclopedia for themselves when invading Beijing.

					<br>
					<br>

					Now, only a copy remains, ordered by Emperor Jiajing after the 1449 Nanjing fire. However, of the copied edition, only 400 volumes have
					been found. Interestingly, the volumes that have been recovered were not only discovered in China but also worldwide in places like Huntington
					Library in California, US.
